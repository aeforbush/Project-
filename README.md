# Travel Bonanza Project 1 
## Travel Bonanza
* Travel application for Project 1 of UofU Coding Bootcamp
* Team members:  Tyler Allison, Sheldon Zane Collins, Aimee Forbush and Blake Hyland 

## Application's concept: 

* Travel Wise is an application designed for the University of Utah's 2021 Coding Bootcamp; specifically for group project 1.  Travel Wise features HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery as well as CSS client-side framework Materialize and Moment().  The muscle behind this application is JavaScript but it also utilizes JQuery and Moment (a legacy language).  Designed for the adventurous at heart, Travel Bonanza randomly selects an inexpensive destination based on choice of departing/returning airport and selected dates.  Additionally, Travel Bonanza will list local events as well as the current weather forecast.
## Project Features:
* Origin Airport search button 
* Random Destination output with Flight Details
* Local Event listings for Random Destination
* Current five day weather forecast for Random Destination
 

## Design Process:

* Use of Zoom for meetings
* Use of Slack for shared materials, quick check-ins and support
* Assigning tasks 
* Discuss the technologies of interest to use
* Developed evolving mockups of desired product 

## Technologies Used:
* API - Skyscanner, OpenWeather and PredictHQ
* Libraries - Materialize for CSS framework and autocomplete
* Programing languages - JavaScript and jQuery

## Future Development Objectives
* Flight Details will include additional data such as; non-stop/connecting flights, flight duration, and how many tickets are left.
* Weather conditions will link to another page that generates and displays weather data for duration of vacation within a 30 day time frame.  Trips planned 30 days or further out would return historical weather data for the selected period of time.  
* Generated local events will link to event homepage to retrieve additional details.
* The app will be friendly for common screen sizes

## Prerequisites
* Installation of this application requires a text editor
